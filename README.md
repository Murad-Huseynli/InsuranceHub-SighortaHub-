## Overview

Traditional car insurance claim processes in Azerbaijan and often beyond involve manual reporting, physical inspections, and lengthy repair approval workflows. SigortaHub addresses these inefficiencies by digitizing and centralizing the entire claims cycle, thereby improving transparency, reducing response times, and enhancing overall service quality.

## Problem Statement

- **Inefficient Processes:** Manual accident reporting and repair management lead to prolonged delays.
- **Delayed Responses:** Extended waiting periods frustrate customers and increase operational costs.
- **Lack of Transparency:** A fragmented system causes inconsistent service quality and unclear procedures.

## Solution Overview

SigortaHub digitalizes the car insurance claims process by:
- Enabling rapid accident reporting with high-quality photo submissions.
- Facilitating a competitive bidding environment for repair service providers.
- Seamlessly integrating with existing insurance protocols to expedite claim settlements.
- Providing real-time updates and notifications to all stakeholders.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** A fully standalone iOS application built using SwiftUI.
- **Backend:** Developed using Django to handle data processing, security, and API management.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for robust and scalable data storage.
- **APIs:** RESTful APIs enable seamless communication between the mobile app and the backend.
- **Cloud Hosting:** Utilizing Contabo services for high availability and scalability.

## Key Features

- **Digital Accident Reporting:** Users can file accident reports quickly by uploading multiple photos for a detailed damage assessment.
- **Competitive Bidding System:** Repair service providers can place bids on claims, fostering a transparent and cost-effective repair process.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Instant notifications keep users informed about claim status and repair progress.
- **User-Centric Design:** Tailored interfaces for car owners, insurance companies, and repair service providers ensure an intuitive user experience.

## Advanced AI & Computer Vision Integration

In addition to our core technology stack, SigortaHub is exploring advanced AI-based computer vision algorithms to automate vehicle damage cost estimation—a vitally important aspect of the insurance claims process. Leveraging state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as   CapsNets and ResNets, our approach analyzes images uploaded by users to determine the extent of damage and estimate repair costs accurately.

To further enhance our capabilities, we are also investigating segmentation methods like U-Net and Mask R-CNN to isolate specific areas of damage in images. This detailed segmentation is intended to provide more precise assessments, reduce manual intervention, and ultimately speed up the claims process.

This potentially seamless integration of AI-driven components with our existing Swift-based front-end, Python-based backend, and PostgreSQL database positions SigortaHub at the forefront of technological innovation in the insurance sector. It promises not only to improve the accuracy of damage assessments but also to reduce associated costs and streamline claim handling overall.
